                     <p><li> The Productivity Improvement Center was established in 1962 as the National Vocational Training Institute under the Ministry of Social Affairs at the time in accordance with the tripartite agreement between the Ethiopian government, the International Labor Organization and the United Nations Development Program.At the time of its establishment, its mission was to provide professional and technical training and vocational assessment tests to professionals from various industries under the government so that they could improve their skills. However, over time, the institution's organization and mission are being changed and improved by the concerned decision-making bodies in order to adapt to the current situation.</li></p>
                    <p><li>  From 1967 to 1976, the center was named the National Productivity Improvement Center and provided short trainings, counseling and professional assessment services to industrial experts and officials throughout the country, contributing to the improvement of productivity. It has been making a significant contribution to the industrial sub-economy by providing entertainment and has been playing its part in the growth of the economy by saving a lot of foreign currency.</li></p>
                    <p><li> From 1977 to 1989, two centers called the National Productivity Center and Mekane Research were merged to form the Ethiopian Management Institute Productivity Improvement Center was organized with the technology training sector and Debrezeit Management Training Center was organized with the management training sector.In 1989, the center was separated from the Ethiopian Business Management Institute and moved to the Addis Ababa City Administration, and since then, especially from 1991 to 1995, it has been managed by the Business Management Board. From 1995 to 1997, under the capacity building office of Addis Ababa, it mobilized the technical professionals who followed the development direction of the city administration and provided extensive professional training to operators of micro and small institutions in ten sub-cities.</li></p>
                    <p><li> From 1997 to 1999, the center was responsible to the Addis Ababa City Administration Trade and Industry Development Office, but since the office was mostly focused on the business sector and did not pay much attention to the industrial sector, it was unable to use the center as much as it was needed. Due to their lack of form, the center did not provide the expected service properly and was unable to achieve its mission. Therefore, by changing the responsibility of the center again, from 2000 to 2002, it returned to the capacity building office and from 2002, it was made to be responsible for the development of micro and small enterprises.</li></p>
                     <p><li> The center was reorganized in 2012 during the reorganization of technical and vocational education and training institutions by the Addis Ababa city administration. In this way, the center merged with 3 institutions called Birth Technical and Vocational Institute, Korea Veterans Memorial Trainers' Center of Excellence, Meles Zenawi Memorial Technology Transfer, Research and Incubation Center and became the representative of the Technical and Vocational Training and Technology Development Office of Addis Ababa City Administration under the new name of Productivity Improvement and Center of Excellence. Although it has been established and operating as a center of excellence, the created organization was given legal recognition by a decree at the end of 2014.</li></p></ul>
